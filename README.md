#Description
In this project, an Exam Portal is being built using Django backend system. The idea is to have
separate login system for the professors and students using their own credentials and an admin at the
topmost level managing the overall system. Currently, MCQ Questions can be created/edited by
professors which can be added to different Question Papers created. Also, different student groups
can be made in which students can be added and question papers can be allotted for the specific
groups. Exam system is being worked upon where the professor can create a new exam and add
question paper and student groups associated with the respective exam
